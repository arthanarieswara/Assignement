## Task 1:
### 2. Write a blog about objects and their internal representation in JavaScript.
#### Objects:
Objects are one of the most important data types in JavaScript. They are used to store collections of data and can be used to model real-world objects. Objects are created using the "**new Object()**" constructor or using object literals. 
Object literals are the most common way to create objects in JavaScript. They are created using curly braces ({}) and contain a list of key-value pairs. The keys are strings and the values can be any valid JavaScript value, including other objects.

Example: 

_cont person = {_

  _    name: "Arthana"_

  _    age: 24_

  _    Occupation" Developer"_

_};_

The above sample program represents the basic declaration of objects.
